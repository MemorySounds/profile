    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        After graduating in 2019 from
        <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >University of Leeds</a
        >
        with a First-Class honours in Computer Science, I spent three years at
        <a href="https://answerdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >Answer Digital</a
        >, starting as a Java developer before gradually moving toward Node.js
        and full-stack JavaScript. I worked on a variety of projects in the
        health sector, from web-apps to data retrieval and reporting tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since moving to Paris, I’ve continued as a freelance developer,
        collaborating with start-ups, co-ops, and charities on projects ranging
        from academic publishing platforms and charity web-shops to semantic web
        experiments involving dataspace connectors. Alongside my freelance work,
        I’ve been a network member of
        <a href="https://code-operative.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >Code-Operative</a
        >
        (a UK-based tech co-op) and
        <a href="https://happy-dev.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >HappyDev</a
        >
        (a French collective of freelance developers), both have now sadly
        wrapped up their endeavors. I am now an active member of
        <a href="https://sepheo.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPHEO</a> —
        a new worker co-op.
      </p>

        I’m comfortable working across the stack, from frontend interfaces to
        backend systems and APIs. I enjoy learning new tools when they’re a good
        fit, but my focus is always on keeping things practical and reliable.
        Most of all, I’m drawn to work that serves people and communities,
        whether that’s through open-source, co-ops, or socially-driven
        initiatives.
